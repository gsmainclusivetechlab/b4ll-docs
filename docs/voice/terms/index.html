that demonstrates the potential of biometrics to authenticate a user‚Äôs
identity to financial service providers in emerging markets. The application
connects to an engine, which connects the user to participating biometric
suppliers offering different biometric solutions, e.g., voice, fingerprint
and facial recognition. The App allows users to choose the type of biometric
solution and the use case they would like to experience. In this fashion,
users can experience the features and functionality of different biometric
solutions in different use cases.</p></li><li><p>There will be no charge for the users to access or use the App.</p></li><li><p>The User shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of
governmental entities, having jurisdiction over such performance, including
(a) maintaining relevant regulatory registrations and notifications as
required under data protection laws; (b) providing all of the required fair
processing information to data subjects, and (c) ensuring it has legitimate
grounds for the processing of personal data, including obtaining all
necessary consents from data subjects where required. User will protect the
privacy and legal rights of its end users and other third parties in
accordance with applicable law.</p></li><li><p>Without limiting the foregoing, User shall process any personal data only in
strict accordance with the instructions of any data subject and shall delete
all personal data of a particular data subject immediately on request.</p></li><li><p>User shall not create derivative works based on any portion of the App. Users
shall not commercially distribute the App. Users shall not use the App for
any illegal or injurious purpose.</p></li><li><p>User acknowledges that GSMA owns all right, title and interest in and to the
App, and that User shall not acquire any right, title, and interest in or to
the App.</p></li><li><p>THE APP IS PROVIDED AND LICENSED ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù. GSMA AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS

FOREGOING, GSMA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT
THE APP WILL MEET USER‚ÄôS REQUIREMENTS, FULFILL ANY OF USER‚ÄôS PARTICULAR
PURPOSES OR NEEDS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR FREE. To the extent that a party may not as a matter of applicable law
disclaim any implied warranty, the scope and duration of such warranty shall
be the minimum permitted by law.</p></li><li><p>GSMA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR

NO EVENT WILL GSMA‚ÄôS OR ITS OFFICERS‚Äô, DIRECTORS‚Äô, EMPLOYEES‚Äô, PARTNER‚ÄôS
AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT, TO USER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, EXCEED \$100.00. THE EXISTENCE
OF MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT SERVE TO ENLARGE THIS LIMITATION. TO THE EXTENT
THAT A PARTY MAY NOT AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW LIMIT ITS LIABILITY, THE
SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED BY LAW.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN. THE WARRANTY
DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS
OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO.</p></li><li><p>These terms and conditions Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
England and Wales Any dispute arising out of or in connection with any
provision of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration held in
London, England, in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of
Commerce. The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other equitable relief. The
arbitrator&#x27;s decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator&#x27;s decision in

obligations with respect to Personal Data Breach investigations, impact
assessments, Data Subject requests and complaints, and consultations with
Supervisory Authority, taking into consideration the nature of Processing and
the information available to Data Processor; (f) be granted general

information security than those in this DPE, (ii) remains liable to Data
Controller for Sub-processors‚Äô acts and omissions with regard to the
Processing of Personal Data under this Agreement, and (iii) informs Data
Controller of any new Sub-processor prior to it starting the Processing of
Personal Data in connection with this DPE. Data Controller may object to the
changes within 10 working days after receipt of such notice and parties will
seek to resolve the matter in good faith. If the parties are unable to
resolve the matter in good faith within 30 days of receipt of the notice,

Data may be Processed on a variety of systems, networks and facilities

(‚ÄúEEA‚Äù) and/or Swiss Personal Data are transferred to a country outside the
EEA, or Switzerland (except to an Adequate Country, as defined by the
