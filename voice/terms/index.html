<ol>
<li>
<p>The Biometrics for All Mobile Application (the “App”) is a mobile application
that demonstrates the potential of biometrics to authenticate a user’s
identity to financial service providers in emerging markets. The application
connects to an engine, which connects the user to participating biometric
suppliers offering different biometric solutions, e.g., voice, fingerprint
and facial recognition. The App allows users to choose the type of biometric
solution and the use case they would like to experience. In this fashion,
users can experience the features and functionality of different biometric
solutions in different use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be no charge for the users to access or use the App.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of
governmental entities, having jurisdiction over such performance, including
(a) maintaining relevant regulatory registrations and notifications as
required under data protection laws; (b) providing all of the required fair
processing information to data subjects, and (c) ensuring it has legitimate
grounds for the processing of personal data, including obtaining all
necessary consents from data subjects where required. User will protect the
privacy and legal rights of its end users and other third parties in
accordance with applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, User shall process any personal data only in
strict accordance with the instructions of any data subject and shall delete
all personal data of a particular data subject immediately on request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User shall not create derivative works based on any portion of the App. Users
shall not commercially distribute the App. Users shall not use the App for
any illegal or injurious purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User acknowledges that GSMA owns all right, title and interest in and to the
App, and that User shall not acquire any right, title, and interest in or to
the App.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE APP IS PROVIDED AND LICENSED “AS IS”. GSMA AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS
AND EMPLOYEES AND LICENSOR(S) DISCLAIM ALL CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY AND VERACITY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT,
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTIES AGAINST
INTERFERENCE WITH USER’S ENJOYMENT OF THE SERVICE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, GSMA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT
THE APP WILL MEET USER’S REQUIREMENTS, FULFILL ANY OF USER’S PARTICULAR
PURPOSES OR NEEDS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR FREE. To the extent that a party may not as a matter of applicable law
disclaim any implied warranty, the scope and duration of such warranty shall
be the minimum permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GSMA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE
THEORY, EVEN IF USER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN
NO EVENT WILL GSMA’S OR ITS OFFICERS’, DIRECTORS’, EMPLOYEES’, PARTNER’S
AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT, TO USER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, EXCEED $100.00. THE EXISTENCE
OF MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT SERVE TO ENLARGE THIS LIMITATION. TO THE EXTENT
THAT A PARTY MAY NOT AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW LIMIT ITS LIABILITY, THE
SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED BY LAW.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN. THE WARRANTY
DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS
OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These terms and conditions Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
England and Wales Any dispute arising out of or in connection with any
provision of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration held in
London, England, in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of
Commerce. The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other equitable relief. The
arbitrator&#x27;s decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator&#x27;s decision in
any court of competent jurisdiction. The non-prevailing party will pay the
costs of arbitration and the prevailing party’s reasonable counsel fees and
expenses.</p>
